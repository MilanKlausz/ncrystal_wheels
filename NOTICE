This software was mainly developed at the European Spallation Source ERIC (ESS)
and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). This work was supported in part
by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under
grant agreement No 676548 (the BrightnESS project).

A substantial effort went into developing NCrystal. If you use it for your work,
we would appreciate it if you would use the following reference in your work

NCrystal exists):

The optional modules available in the ncrystal_extra/ directory contain open
source code from third-parties, and usage of these must naturally oblige by
their licenses as well, as detailed in the file ncrystal_extra/LICENSE. If
building via CMake, these extra modules and their license requirements can be
disabled by supplying the -DBUILD_EXTRA=OFF flag. Alternatively, if integrating
NCrystal code by hand into an existing build system, one can simply ignore files
in the ncrystal_extra/ directory to obtain the same result.
