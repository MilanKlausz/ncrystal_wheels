v0.9.8 2018-03-19
      * Decouple PhononDebye background cross-section code from .ncmat format,
        making it the new default also for .nxs files. For .nxs files, it is
        still possible to select the old behaviour of using curves provided by
        nxslib itself by configuring those files with "bkgd=external".  A side
        benefit of this splitout can in some cases result in significant faster
        initialisation times when working with .ncmat files.
      * Major cleanup and renaming of configuration variables, in preparation of
        the 1.0.0 release milestone. The renames are: "mosaicity"->"mos",
        "orientationprimary"->"dir1, "orientationsecondary"->"dir2",
        "orientationtolerance"->"dirtol", "packingfactor"->"packfact",
        "dcutoffupper"->"dcutoffup", "scatterbkgdmodel"->"bkgd",
        scatterfactory"->"scatfactory, absorptionfactory->absnfactory and
        "skippbragg" becomes "bragg" but with opposite logic, e.g. bragg=0
        disables Bragg diffraction). Removed entirely was the variables
        braggonly (use "bkgd=none" or "bkgd=0" instead now) and
        "nphonon". Experts can now instead tune parameters for specific
        background models by embedding them in the "bkgd" parameter value
        itself, e.g. "bkgd=phonondebye:nphonon@20".
      * dirtol (old orientationtolerance) default changed to 180 degrees.
      * Temporarily disable single-crystal speedup code while we investigate
        further, due to concerns that it is too aggresive (see github issue #13).

v0.9.7 2018-03-06
      * Don't produce floating point exception when loading .ncmat files with H,
        Li, Ti, V or Mn (github issue #8).
      * McStas component now actually applies requested packingfactor for powder
        materials (github issue #9).

v0.9.6 2018-02-07
      * Fix visualisation of box-shaped sample in McStas component.
      * Rename McStas component parameter multscatt to multscat.

v0.9.5 2018-02-05
      * Add support for python3 (github issue #6).

v0.9.4 2018-01-31
      * Correct version numbers.

v0.9.3 2018-01-31
      * NCrystal_sample.comp (McStas interface): Fix link flags on OSX
        (github issue #3) and compilation warnings (github issue #4).

v0.9.2 2018-01-23
      * Fix cross-section and material composition bugs in Geant4
        interface. Only affects Geant4 users.
      * CMakeLists.txt: Always use absolute rpath (needed on OSX).
      * Fix gcc7 compilation.

v0.9.1 2017-08-30
      * Proper behaviour of python interface if Numpy is absent.

v0.9.0 2017-08-30
      * First github based public release of NCrystal.
