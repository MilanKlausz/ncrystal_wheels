INSTALL             : Build, installation and brief usage instructions.
FILES               : This file.
CMakeLists.txt......: Configuration file for building and installing via CMake
                      (cf. the INSTALL file for instructions).
data/...............: Material data files, either in NCrystals native format
                      (.ncmat) or in .nxs format (reading the latter needs the
                      optional code from ./ncrystal_extra/ enabled).
examples/...........: Small standalone examples for using NCrystal, either from
                      the commandline, C, C++ or python applications or through
                      Geant4 simulations in C++.
ncrystal_core/......: The core NCrystal code implemented in C++. Public header
                      files for C++ and C are available in the
                      ncrystal_core/include/NCrystal/ directory, and the
                      implementation is in ncrystal_core/src/. Internal header
                      files can also be accessed in the internal/ subdirectory,
                      but are not guaranteed to present a stable API, and also
                      do not contain NCRYSTAL_API statements needed for symbol
                      visibility in certain builds.
ncrystal_geant4/....: NCrystal-Geant4 interface classes, with public header
                      files for Geant4-dependent C++ code available in the
                      ncrystal_geant4/include/G4NCrystal/ directory, and the
                      implementation in ncrystal_geant4/src/.
ncrystal_mcstas/....: NCrystal-McStas interface files, with sample component
                      and a script to prepare a given McStas rundir for using it.
ncrystal_python/....: NCrystal python module and python-based scripts, including
                      the ncrystal_inspectfile script and tools for NCMAT file
                      preparation.
ncrystal_extra/.....: Contains optional code available under different licensing
                      conditions than the rest of NCrystal. Currently this just
                      includes a component for loading .nxs, .lau or .laz
                      files. See the dedicated LICENSE file inside the
                      ncrystal_extra/ directory for usage conditions. Inclusion
                      of the optional components is controlled via the
                      BUILD_EXTRA flag when building via CMake.
docs/...............: Extra documentation. Currently this is just ncmat_doc.md
                      with a thorough description of the NCMAT format.
cmake/..............: Other files needed for CMake configuration.
